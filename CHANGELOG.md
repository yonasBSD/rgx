# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.12.6] - 2026-06-02

### Features

- *(ui)* Add scrollability and hjkl navigation to help overlay ([#73](https://github.com/brevity1swos/rgx/pull/73))


## [0.12.5] - 2026-05-31

### Refactoring

- *(tests)* Clear pedantic clippy warnings in test code
Five test-only clippy warnings that were left from the v0.12.4
  maintenance sweep. None affect runtime; all were CI-silent (the project
  enforces -D warnings without pedantic). Cleaned up so a future pedantic
  audit starts from zero:

  - tests/filter_tests.rs: replace `(0..N).map(format!).collect()` with
    a loop using writeln! (format_collect × 2)
  - src/ui/syntax_highlight.rs::test_dot: collapse `Vec collect + contains`
    to `.any()` (needless_collect)
  - src/ui/syntax_highlight.rs::test_named_group: collapse `Vec collect +
    .len()` to `.count()` (needless_collect)
  - tests/engine_tests.rs::run_print: switch Path Debug formatting to
    Display via `bin.display()` (unnecessary_debug_formatting)


## [0.12.4] - 2026-05-31

### Documentation

- *(readme)* Promote step-through debugger and sharpen hero tagline
Move the step-through debugger to the top of the features list — it is
  rgx's only feature with no equivalent in any other terminal regex tool,
  so it should be the first thing a visitor reads. Update the hero tagline
  to lead with "regex debugger" and call out code generation and live
  stream filtering explicitly.
- Refresh demo GIF (v7)
Re-recorded against v0.12.3 binary with PCRE2. Now shows step-through
  debugger (Ctrl+D), grex overlay (Ctrl+X), code generation (Ctrl+G),
  and filter mode — all features that shipped after the previous recording.
- *(readme)* Document Ctrl+B, Ctrl+U, and -P in features list

### Refactoring

- Apply mechanical clippy cleanups across codebase
Inline format args (uninlined_format_args), collapse map().unwrap_or()
  into map_or(), drop redundant closures, elide explicit lifetimes, and
  remove a redundant to_string(). Pure shape changes — no behavior or
  public API change. All tests pass.
- Hoist shared tail code in history_next and move_word_left
Both functions had identical statements at the end of both branches
  (branches_sharing_code lint). Pull them out so the conditional only
  selects the value that differs.
- Drop format!-into-String and promote eligible fns to const
Two clippy-driven cleanups in one pass:

  - Replace `String::push_str(&format!(..))` with `write!`/`writeln!` so
    the formatted output writes directly into the buffer instead of
    allocating an intermediate String.
  - Mark pure, copy-only, no-trait-call functions as `const fn` (lint
    missing_const_for_fn). Additive change — callers can now use them in
    const contexts; behavior is unchanged.
- Prefer Self in impl blocks and nested or-patterns in matches


## [0.12.3] - 2026-05-23

### Bug Fixes

- *(filter)* Harden filter subsystem against OOM, engine mismatch, and bad diagnostics
- Drain overflowed lines in 64 KiB bounded chunks to prevent OOM when
    the tail of an oversized line contains no newline
  - Use detect_minimum_engine() in filter_lines, filter_lines_with_extracted,
    and FilterApp so lookahead/backref patterns work in all modes; eliminates
    TUI vs non-interactive engine divergence
  - Split read_input return into (lines, line_truncated, byte_truncated) so
    the truncation warning correctly identifies the cause instead of always
    printing the line-count cap message for byte-level truncation
  - Fix parse_quoted_key escape error to read the full UTF-8 char via
    str::from_utf8 instead of casting a raw byte with 'other as char',
    which misreported multi-byte sequences as Latin-1 characters

### Documentation

- *(changelog)* Scrub private project references from history entries
Remove mentions of sibling tools and the landing-site project from
  changelog entries across v0.12.0–v0.12.2. Inline descriptions now
  reference only rgx-visible concepts (piping, filter mode, standalone
  presentation) so the public changelog is self-contained.
- Update shortcuts, comparison table, and roadmap for v0.12.3
Ctrl+Y entry now reflects context-aware copy (regex vs matches panel).
  Comparison table row updated to "Clipboard copy (pattern & match)".
  ROADMAP updated to 2026-05-23 with v0.12.3 unreleased feature summary.

### Features

- *(ui)* Context-aware Ctrl+Y copy and Quick Reference help page
Ctrl+Y now copies the pattern when the regex panel is focused and the
  selected match when the matches panel is focused, closing the most
  common clipboard request without adding a new key binding.

  The F1 Quick Reference page (was "Common Regex Syntax") is reorganized
  into three labeled sections — Sequences, Classes & Groups, Quantifiers —
  and gains \t \n \r and a lookahead hint. Overlay height bumped to 28
  to accommodate the expanded content.


## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-19

### Documentation

- Restore rgx to independent-project presentation
Reverts README and ROADMAP changes that briefly appeared earlier today.
  rgx is presented as a standalone tool; users who arrived through
  Terminal Trove, awesome-ratatui, or AUR didn't sign up for an
  unrelated stack pitch on their regex debugger's README.


## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes

- *(app)* Explain failures no longer abort -p mode after successful compile

### Documentation

- *(readme)* Slim to quickstart + link to docs/
README grew to 431 lines over v0.11.0 and v0.12.0 — past the point
  where first-time readers scroll through the content they actually
  need (install + "does it do X?"). Splits into a focused README
  (121 lines) plus four topic pages under docs/:

  - docs/usage.md         — CLI flags, batch mode, filter mode, --json
                            JSONL recipes, workspaces, completions
  - docs/shortcuts.md     — main TUI, vim mode, filter mode tables
  - docs/integrations.md  — VS Code, Neovim, Zed, tmux
  - docs/advanced.md      — test suite mode, config, engine matrix,
                            comparison vs terminal tools + regex101

  The new README keeps the header, "who is this for?", one-liner
  install, five-line quickstart, a compressed feature list, and an
  engines-at-a-glance table. Everything deeper is one click away.

  Total content preserved; anchors and internal links verified.

### Features

- *(filter)* Post-v0.11.0 hardening and cleanup pass
Three new capabilities:

  - 10 MiB per-line byte cap (MAX_LINE_BYTES) in read_input prevents
    an unbounded line from OOMing before --max-lines engages.
    Truncation is reflected in the returned `truncated` flag, and the
    max-lines-exceeded peek is now bounded to a single byte so a giant
    post-cap line can't OOM the peek itself.
  - Bracketed string-key syntax in json_path: ["hyphen-key"], ["日本語"],
    etc. Unlocks --json addressing for keys that aren't bare
    identifiers. Recognises \" and \\ escapes; unknown escapes error.
  - rgx::filter::match_haystack promoted to pub — the helper all three
    match paths already use is now callable from third-party
    integrations.

### Refactoring

- Clippy modernization + small simplifications across codebase
Post-v0.12.0 sweep through every crate module. No behavior change;
  each hunk is either a modern-idiom rewrite clippy flagged or a
  dead-code / redundant-closure cleanup.

  - main.rs: merge duplicate debug-jump-start match arms (Home and 'g'
    both call the same handler — fold into one arm)
  - ui/mod.rs: `border_type` doc comment now names the real parameter;
    `render_codegen_overlay` takes `EngineFlags` by value (it is Copy)
  - app.rs:
    - `truncate()` collapses two `chars()` passes into one `char_indices().nth()`
    - `history_next` uses `let...else` for the `None` early return
    - `map(String::as_str)` and `map(ToString::to_string)` replace one-shot
      closures that clippy::redundant_closure_for_method_calls flagged
  - explain/formatter.rs: `format!("{}", lit.c)` → `lit.c.to_string()`
  - engine/mod.rs: `|b| b.is_ascii_digit()` → `u8::is_ascii_digit`
  - engine/pcre2.rs: `and_then(|n| n.clone())` → `and_then(Clone::clone)`
  - engine/pcre2_debug.rs: `let...else` for the early `Vec::new()` return
  - filter/mod.rs: `extract_strings` flattens its JSON decode with
    `.ok().and_then(..)` instead of `match Ok/Err`
  - filter/ui.rs: `map(Vec::as_slice)` replaces the redundant closure
  - input/editor.rs: `line_end` uses `map_or`; `drain(a..b + 1)` → `drain(a..=b)`
  - config/workspace.rs: `match Ok/Err` collapses to `Result::is_ok_and`
  - ui/syntax_highlight.rs: `let...else` for the AST-parse early return

  349 tests passing, clippy -D warnings clean, rustfmt clean.
- *(engine)* Align EngineFlags default with runtime, add regex-style prefix
No user-visible behavior change. Two cleanups that set up the next
  commit's `-p` fix and guard against a latent bug the existing tests
  weren't catching.

  - `EngineFlags::default()` now has `unicode: true`. The old derived
    default had `unicode: false` (the bool default), which diverged from
    the runtime `Settings::default().unicode = true`. Every production
    caller already overrode this via the `EngineFlags { ... }` literal in
    main.rs, but tests using `EngineFlags::default()` were silently
    testing a configuration no user ever hits.
  - New `to_regex_inline_prefix` (private) is the `wrap_pattern` helper
    for the `regex` and `fancy-regex` engines. Emits `(?-u)` only when
    unicode is explicitly disabled; never emits `(?u)` because unicode
    is default-on in both engines. This is a correctness fix: emitting
    `(?u)` in front of a lookaround pattern has been observed to push
    fancy-regex into its non-fancy backend in our build, which then
    errors with "look-around not supported".
  - Existing `to_inline_prefix` stays as-is for PHP codegen (where `u`
    flips to mean "enable unicode", opposite of the regex crate).
  - Both `to_*` methods take `&self` for API stability; `#[allow]` on
    `clippy::wrong_self_convention` since `EngineFlags` is `Copy` so the
    borrow is free.

  New tests:
  - `wrap_pattern_omits_prefix_when_flags_are_defaults` / `_emits_minus_u_when_unicode_disabled` /
    `_combines_enable_and_disable_unicode` / `_does_not_emit_u_when_unicode_on` —
    pin the new prefix semantics.
  - `to_inline_prefix_still_emits_positive_u_for_php` — locks the split
    between the two prefix methods.
  - `test_lookahead_with_unicode_flag` / `test_lookbehind_with_unicode_flag` —
    regression guards at the fancy-engine layer.

  All 360 tests passing, clippy -D warnings clean, rustfmt clean.


## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-18

### Documentation

- *(roadmap)* Reflect v0.11.0 shipped state and open next-round decision gate
v0.11.0 shipped grex overlay AND rgx filter — filter landed in-cycle because
  it was low cost and opened piping use cases. Road A's spirit (avoid a
  2-3 month ripgrep fight) still holds; filter is a bounded addition, not a
  grep replacement.

  Decision gate now open:
    1. Filter Scope C (JSONL --json <path>, ~1-2 days)
    2. Filter polish (match highlighting, UTF-8-lossy, --max-lines, ~1 day)
    3. Genuine maintenance mode (reinvest in SaaS projects)

  Until chosen, rgx is in de-facto maintenance mode.
- *(filter)* Document --json flag and update roadmap
Adds the --json flag to the filter-mode feature bullet and to the
  filter usage section with a concrete JSONL example (wildcards are out
  of scope for v1 so the example uses a direct dotted path). Notes
  the silent-skip behavior for parse failures, missing paths, and
  non-string values.

  Moves Filter Scope C from the roadmap decision gate to Recently
  Shipped; the current posture is genuine maintenance mode.
- *(filter)* Generalize filter examples and prune internal plan doc
Replace the README's third-party-tool piping recipes with generic JSONL
  and diff-filter examples so the docs stand on their own without naming
  private integrations. Same goes for the ROADMAP phrasing.

  Also removes the internal implementation plan doc for the filter mode;
  it served its purpose during development, but the feature is shipped
  and the plan adds no value to readers of the repo.
- *(filter)* Escape brackets in json_path grammar comment
rustdoc intra-doc link check (-D warnings) interpreted [A-Za-z0-9_] as
  a broken doc link and failed the Docs CI job, blocking the v0.12.0
  release PR. Escape the brackets with backslashes so rustdoc treats
  them as literal characters.

### Features

- *(filter)* Highlight match spans in results pane
Before this change the filter results pane showed matching lines but gave
  no visual indication of WHERE in each line the pattern matched — users had
  to rescan the line to find the hit. Main rgx has alternated match-span
  backgrounds in ui/match_display.rs; bring the same affordance to filter.

  - FilterApp now carries a parallel match_spans: Vec<Vec<Range<usize>>>
    populated alongside matched. Invert mode stores empty per-line vecs
    (nothing to highlight when showing non-matching lines).
  - render_match_list splits each line on span boundaries and paints
    matched segments with alternating theme::MATCH_BG / MATCH_BG_ALT.
  - Selection still applies Modifier::REVERSED to the full row.
- *(filter)* Read input as UTF-8-lossy (match grep behavior)
- *(filter)* --max-lines cap prevents OOM on unbounded streams
Without a cap, `rgx filter` happily slurps multi-GB piped streams into
  a Vec<String> and crashes the process. Add --max-lines (default 100000)
  that stops reading once the cap is hit and prints a one-line stderr
  warning so the user knows the tail was dropped. Pass 0 to disable the
  cap.

  - FilterArgs gains `max_lines: usize` (default 100_000).
  - read_input now takes max_lines and returns (Vec<String>, bool) where
    the bool is true iff the cap was hit before EOF. It peeks one extra
    read after the cap so a file that happens to have exactly max_lines
    lines is NOT flagged as truncated.
  - run_entry threads the flag through and emits
    `rgx filter: input truncated at N lines (use --max-lines to override)`
    on truncation.
  - Existing read_input tests destructure the new tuple. New tests cover
    the cap path, the exact-fit boundary, and the zero-means-no-cap case.
- *(filter)* Add json_path module with dotted/indexed parser
Introduces src/filter/json_path.rs with a minimal path language
  (.field / .nested / .items[0] / .steps[0].text) for JSONL field
  extraction. Pure parser only; extractor lands in the next commit.
- *(filter)* Add extract() for json_path segments
Walks a serde_json::Value along the parsed path, returning None on
  any miss (wrong type, absent key, out-of-bounds index). Pure function,
  exhaustive unit tests for single/nested/indexed/mixed paths.
- *(filter)* Add --json CLI flag and extract_strings helper
Adds --json <PATH> to FilterArgs and a filter::extract_strings()
  helper that parses each JSONL line, walks the path, and returns
  Some(string) or None per line. Parse failures, missing paths, and
  non-string values all coerce to None so callers can treat those
  lines as non-matches uniformly.
- *(filter)* --json honored in non-interactive paths with CLI e2e test
Adds filter_lines_with_extracted() which applies the pattern to a
  per-line extracted value and returns the raw-line indices to emit.
  Lines whose extracted value is None (parse failure, missing path,
  non-string) are excluded unconditionally — even in invert mode.

  run_entry threads the --json path through extract_strings once up
  front, then uses the extracted vector for matching in the
  non-interactive path. Raw JSON lines are still what get emitted.
  TUI wiring follows in the next commit.
- *(filter)* FilterApp honors --json path for in-TUI matching
Adds FilterApp::with_json_extracted() and a json_extracted field.
  When set, recompute() matches the pattern against the per-line
  extracted string instead of the raw line, and match_spans refer to
  offsets within the extracted string. None entries (parse failures,
  missing paths, non-string values) are excluded in both forward and
  invert modes. The raw JSON line is still what the UI/emit path sees.
- *(filter)* Render extracted JSON field with arrow prefix in TUI
In --json mode each match row renders two visual lines on wide
  terminals: the raw JSON line (dim, for context) followed by
  `↳ <extracted>` with match spans highlighted. Under 60 cols the
  renderer falls back to a single line showing just the extracted
  value with highlighting. Scroll math now accounts for the per-row
  line count so selection still snaps into view.


## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-18

### Bug Fixes

- *(filter)* Plain 'q' belongs in the pattern; keep selection in view
Two fixes from code-review feedback on the filter mode:

  - Removed the plain-'q' exit shortcut. It hijacked the letter 'q' so users
    could not type patterns like `quote`, `sequence`, or `\bq\w+`. Esc and
    Ctrl+C already handle discard. Added a regression test.

  - The matched-line pane used app.scroll (never mutated after init), so
    pressing Down past the viewport moved selection off-screen. Render now
    derives a start offset that keeps selected visible. app.scroll is retained
    as a hint for a future page-up/down binding. Added a regression test.
- *(event)* Collapse nested if into outer match (clippy 1.95)
rust 1.95's clippy::collapsible_match flagged the per-arm send-and-break
  pattern in the EventHandler's reader.next() branch. Refactor to a single
  translation match that produces an AppEvent, followed by one send point.
  Clearer intent (translate → forward), fewer branches, satisfies clippy.

  CI was green on rust 1.93 but started failing once the toolchain bumped
  to 1.95 mid-release cycle.

### Documentation

- Document Road A direction and v0.11.0 grex overlay design
Road A commits rgx to a final polish release (v0.11.0 — grex overlay
  integration) followed by maintenance-only mode, with capacity reinvested
  into revenue-generating side projects. ROADMAP.md captures the direction
  change, the v0.11.0 scope, and the non-negotiable editor-mode parity
  commitment during maintenance.

  The grex overlay spec locks in six design decisions from brainstorming:
  one-example-per-line text area, 150ms debounced regeneration via
  spawn_blocking with a generation counter for stale-result suppression,
  three flag toggles (digit/anchors/case-insensitive) mirroring the main
  flag row, Tab-accepts / Esc-cancels, dimmed placeholder for empty state,
  and Ctrl+X as the shortcut. Covers architecture, data flow, layout,
  testing strategy (unit + snapshot + end-to-end + vim regression), and
  explicit out-of-scope items to hold the line against scope creep.
- Add v0.11.0 grex overlay implementation plan
13 bite-sized tasks with TDD steps: grex dep + GrexOptions, generate()
  wrapper with flag tests, GrexOverlayState skeleton, Ctrl+X binding,
  handle_action(OpenGrex), empty-state render, render wiring + help page,
  overlay key handler (Tab/Esc/Alt toggles), debounced spawn_blocking
  with stale-result suppression, populated snapshots, end-to-end
  roundtrip, vim regression guards, and README/CLAUDE.md/demo polish.

  Plan follows the design spec at
  docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-11-grex-overlay-design.md.
- *(grex)* Add Ctrl+X to README features and CLAUDE.md architecture
- *(filter)* README feature list, shortcuts table, and piping recipes
- *(filter)* Move rgx filter to shipped in roadmap
- *(filter)* Commit the v0.12 filter mode implementation plan
13-task plan executed in prior commits (6e6eba9..32f8373).
  Saved for future reference and auditability.

### Features

- *(grex)* Add grex dependency and GrexOptions struct
- *(grex)* Implement generate() wrapper with flag handling
- *(grex)* Add GrexOverlayState with default constructor
- *(grex)* Bind Ctrl+X to Action::OpenGrex and open overlay
- *(grex)* Render overlay, wire into ui::render, add to help page
- *(grex)* Implement overlay key handler with Tab/Esc/flag toggles
- *(grex)* Debounced spawn_blocking generation with stale-result suppression
- *(filter)* Add rgx filter subcommand to CLI
- *(filter)* Add filter_lines pure function with tests
- *(filter)* Add read_input helper for stdin or file source
- *(filter)* Emit_matches and emit_count non-interactive helpers
- *(filter)* TTY-aware entry dispatcher with non-interactive paths
Uses std::io::IsTerminal rather than adding is-terminal crate dependency,
  matching the existing pattern in main.rs.
- *(filter)* Wire Command::Filter in main.rs + e2e CLI tests
- *(filter)* FilterApp state struct with recompute logic
- *(filter)* TUI render function with pattern, match list, status
- *(filter)* TUI event loop with key handling and emit/discard outcomes

## [0.10.2] - 2026-04-09

### Bug Fixes

- Pcre2 zero-length match offset bug, replace bare unwrap with expect
- Fix `offset += abs_end + 1` → `offset = abs_end + 1` in PCRE2
    find_matches() — the += caused skipped matches when a zero-length
    match occurred at a non-zero position after the first iteration
  - Replace bare .unwrap() with .expect() on capture group 0 across all
    three engine implementations (rust_regex, fancy, pcre2) and in
    expand_replacement() for peeked iterator values
  - Deduplicate whitespace visualization flush pattern in test_input.rs

### Documentation

- Update CONTRIBUTING.md architecture section
Add codegen, recipe, ansi, workspace, debugger, syntax highlighting,
  and vim mode to the architecture overview. Reflects current v0.10.1
  source tree.


## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes

- Use runtime PCRE2 version detection instead of hard-coded pcre2-sys constants
  `pcre2::version()` returns compile-time constants baked into `pcre2-sys`,
  not the actual linked library version. This caused the CVE-2025-58050
  guard and status bar warning to trigger incorrectly on systems linking
  against PCRE2 >= 10.46 (e.g. NixOS). Now calls `pcre2_config_8` directly
  to query the real runtime version.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes

- Escape [[tests]] in doc comment to fix rustdoc link error
- Preserve debug cache on miss, extract overlay size constants
- Don't consume debug_cache with .take() when pattern doesn't match;
    use ref check first so cache survives for future reopens
  - Extract OVERLAY_WIDTH/OVERLAY_HEIGHT constants from magic numbers

### Documentation

- Update README with code generation, auto engine, test suite mode
Add new features to feature list, keyboard shortcuts table, usage
  examples, and comparison tables. Add test suite TOML format section.
  Add AUR installation method. Update regex101 comparison to reflect
  that code generation is no longer a gap.
- *(vscode)* Update extension to v0.3.0 with new features
Add code generation, auto engine selection, test suite mode,
  alternating match colors, recipe library, and regex101 export
  to the feature list. Add key shortcuts table. Add AUR install
  method. Bump to v0.3.0.
- Update demo tape with code generation, auto engine, alternating colors
Add Ctrl+G code generation overlay, auto engine selection with
  lookahead pattern, and alternating match colors to the VHS demo.
  Reorganized flow for better pacing.
- Regenerate demo GIF with code generation and auto engine features
Updated demo shows: code generation overlay (Ctrl+G), alternating
  match colors, auto engine selection with lookahead pattern, and
  existing features. Cache-bust v=5.
- Slow down code generation section in demo GIF
Increase sleep durations in the Ctrl+G code generation overlay
  section for better readability. 400ms → 1s per language browse,
  1.5s → 3s for overlay display.
- Update roadmap — move shipped features, add new goals
Code generation, test suite mode, alternating colors, and auto
  engine selection are all shipped. New goals: step-through debugger,
  theme customization, regex101 URL import.
- Add step-through debugger design spec
Design for a PCRE2 callout-based step-through regex debugger with
  dual-cursor visualization, backtrack markers, and heatmap mode.
- Add step-through debugger implementation plan
11 tasks covering FFI layer, data model, offset mapping, UI overlay,
  event loop integration, config, tests, and verification.
- Update README, roadmap, demo, and VS Code extension for debugger
- Add step-through debugger to features, keyboard shortcuts, and
    comparison tables in README
  - Update "vs regex101" section — rgx now has its own debugger
  - Move debugger to "Recently Shipped" in roadmap
  - Add debugger section to demo tape (step-through, heatmap)
  - Bump VS Code extension to v0.4.0 with debugger keywords
  - Fix clippy field_reassign_with_default in debugger_tests.rs

### Features

- *(vscode)* Improve marketplace discoverability
Add extension icon, richer description, better categories (Debuggers,
  Testing), expanded keywords, gallery banner, and LICENSE file. Bump to
  v0.2.0.
- Alternate highlight colors between adjacent matches
Even/odd matches now use distinct background colors for visual
  distinction, especially when matches are adjacent or dense.
  Applies to both the test string panel and the match list panel.
- Add code generation (Ctrl+G) for 8 languages
Generate ready-to-use code from the current pattern and flags.
  Select a language from the overlay, copies to clipboard.
- Auto-select engine based on pattern features
Detect lookahead, lookbehind, backreferences, recursion, and
  backtracking verbs in the pattern and auto-upgrade to the
  simplest engine that supports them. Never auto-downgrades.

  Shows a status message when auto-switching occurs.
  Includes 14 unit tests for pattern detection.
- Add test suite mode (--test) for CI-integrated regex validation
Run `rgx --test file.toml` to validate regex patterns against
  should-match/should-not-match assertions. Supports multiple files.
  Exit code 0 = all pass, 1 = failures, 2 = error.

  Extends workspace TOML format with optional [[tests]] sections.
  Colored pass/fail output in terminals.
- *(vscode)* Update extension icon with /rgx/ regex delimiter design
- *(debug)* Add data model and offset map builder for step-through debugger
Introduces DebugStep, PatternToken, and DebugTrace structs plus build_offset_map()
  and find_token_at_offset() helpers that walk the regex-syntax AST to map pattern
  byte offsets to human-readable token descriptions.
- *(debug)* Implement PCRE2 callout-based debug_match via raw FFI
Add the core debug_match function that compiles patterns with
  PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT, installs a callout handler to collect execution
  steps (including backtrack detection via PCRE2_CALLOUT_BACKTRACK),
  and returns a DebugTrace with steps, heatmap, and match attempt count.

  Manually declares the Pcre2CalloutBlock struct and pcre2_set_callout_8
  function that are blocklisted by pcre2-sys. Adds pcre2-sys as a direct
  dependency behind the pcre2-engine feature flag.
- *(debug)* Add ToggleDebugger action, app state, and config
Wire up Ctrl+D → ToggleDebugger across the action enum, vim global
  shortcuts, App struct (show_debugger, debug_trace, debug_step,
  debug_show_heatmap, debug_error fields + all navigation methods), and
  Settings.debug_max_steps (default 10_000).
- *(debug)* Add debugger overlay UI, event loop handler, and help entry
- Create src/ui/debugger.rs: full-screen RED-bordered overlay with pattern
    panel (YELLOW token highlight), subject panel (TEAL position highlight),
    step/backtrack info, optional heatmap (BLUE→PEACH→RED gradient), capture
    display, and controls footer; gated on pcre2-engine feature
  - Modify src/ui/mod.rs: declare debugger module, inject render_debugger call
    after codegen overlay, add Ctrl+D shortcut to help page 0
  - Modify src/main.rs: add debugger overlay key handler (←/→/h/l/Home/End/g/G/
    m/f/H/Esc/q); fix ToggleDebugger to only open (start_debug) or only close

### Refactoring

- Simplify workspace, codegen, and fix doc link
- Extract engine_kind() and flags() helpers in Workspace to
    deduplicate engine parsing and flag construction
  - Make TestResult.passed() a method instead of stored field
  - Change Language::all() from Vec allocation to static slice
  - Escape [[tests]] in doc comment to fix rustdoc link error
- Extract escape helper and reuse inline_prefix in codegen
- Extract escape_double_quoted() to deduplicate pattern escaping
    in Rust, Python, and Java generators
  - Reuse EngineFlags::to_inline_prefix() for PHP flag building
- Extract collect_flags helper, fix formatting in theme
- Add collect_flags() to deduplicate flag-building in Python, Java,
    and C# code generators
  - Fix missing blank line after match_bg() in theme.rs
- Fix debugger tech debt — dedup overlay, surface errors, tidy imports
- Share centered_overlay() from ui/mod.rs instead of duplicating in debugger.rs
  - Surface debug errors via status bar instead of silent debug_error field
  - Remove unused debug_error field from App
  - Move regex-syntax imports to file top in pcre2_debug.rs
  - Restore launch/r_commandline.md to clean state
- Simplify debugger code after review
- Remove redundant DebugStep::index field (always equals Vec position)
  - Extract panel_block() helper to deduplicate 4 identical Block builders
  - Replace hand-written token descriptions with explain::formatter functions
  - Replace magic callout return values with named constants
  - Collapse find_token_at_offset double-scan into single pass
  - Move centered_overlay import to top of debugger.rs
  - Remove WHAT comments, improve WHY comments
  - Remove section banner comments
  - Remove duplicate integration tests (covered by unit tests)
- Introduce DebugSession, shared parse_ast, char span helper, trace cache, byte_to_token precomputation
Co-locates debugger state into DebugSession struct, extracts shared
  parse_ast helper to avoid duplicated AST parsing, adds build_char_spans
  to DRY the char-iteration pattern, caches debug traces across
  close/reopen, and pre-computes byte_to_token map for O(1) heatmap
  lookups.
- Remove redundant params, use byte_to_token in captures, fix cfg gates
- render_debugger reads pattern/subject from DebugSession instead of
    extra params (8 -> 4 args)
  - render_captures uses byte_to_token O(1) lookup instead of
    find_token_at_offset O(n) scan
  - Remove Option<()> dummy field for non-PCRE2 builds; gate call sites
    with #[cfg] instead
  - close_debug() saves session to cache preserving step/heatmap state
    on reopen
  - Cache stores full DebugSession instead of just the trace
- Resolve pre-existing tech debt
- Extract shared ansi module to deduplicate ANSI escape constants
    between app.rs and workspace.rs
  - Remove dead ThemeSettings struct and catppuccin field (never read)
  - Surface create_dir_all error in workspace save instead of swallowing
  - Hoist inline `use Workspace` imports to top-level in main.rs
  - Move url_encode from nested function to module-level
  - Replace magic numbers with named constants (MAX_PATTERN_HISTORY,
    STATUS_DISPLAY_TICKS, MAX_UNDO_STACK)
  - Document switch_engine_to low-level contract

### Testing

- Add integration tests for step-through debugger
Covers debug_match end-to-end, backtracking detection with heatmap
  validation, offset map accuracy, find_token_at_offset, flag handling
  (case-insensitive, unicode), all gated behind #![cfg(feature = "pcre2-engine")].

### Ci

- Update VS Code extension workflow to Node.js 22
Node.js 20 is deprecated on GitHub Actions runners starting
  June 2, 2026. Upgrade proactively to avoid forced migration.


## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-01

### Bug Fixes

- Block CVE-2025-58050 (*scs:) verb on PCRE2 10.45, add status bar warning
On PCRE2 10.45, patterns invoking the scan-substring verb (*scs:) /
  (*SCAN_SUBSTRING:) are rejected before reaching the vulnerable pcre2_match
  code path. All other PCRE2 patterns are unaffected.

  A persistent red warning badge is shown in the status bar whenever the PCRE2
  engine is active on an affected version, prompting users to upgrade to >= 10.46.

  Documents CVE-2025-58050 in the README PCRE2 install section.

Add --print/-p flag for non-interactive batch mode that skips the TUI
  entirely when pattern and input are provided. Add --output-pattern/-P
  to capture the final pattern after an interactive session.

  Exit codes: 0 = match found, 1 = no match, 2 = error.
  Input priority: --text > --file > stdin (prevents blocking).

  Update launch posts and playbook with pipeline examples.


## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-02

### Documentation

- Rewrite positioning with honest audience framing
Drop "regex101, but in your terminal" tagline in favor of grounded
  positioning that acknowledges regex101.com as the more capable tool
  overall. Add "Who is this for?" section to README targeting the actual
  niche: remote/SSH work, shell pipelines, and engine-specific testing.

  Split comparison table into terminal alternatives (factual) and vs.
  regex101 (honest prose). Update all launch posts, CLI about string,
  and Cargo.toml description to match.


## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-26

### Documentation

- Revise Show HN post for launch
Tighten copy for HN audience: shorter title, personal pain point
  opening, fewer feature bullets, remove self-promotional comparison
  table, reframe closing CTA around user workflows.
- Revise r/rust post for launch
Tighten for r/rust audience: rename technical section to highlight
  architecture discussion, emphasize trait design and pure Rust build,
  trim feature list, add concrete details that invite technical feedback.


## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-26

### Bug Fixes

- Bounds safety, VecDeque history, config wiring, and code quality
- Fix scroll_to_selected() bounds check and u16 overflow safety
  - Change pattern_history from Vec to VecDeque for O(1) front-removal

    flag prefix logic in rust_regex.rs and fancy.rs
  - Add named panel constants (PANEL_REGEX, PANEL_TEST, etc.) replacing
    magic numbers; consolidate editor dispatch with closures
  - Expand Settings with flag fields, parse_engine(); make CLI engine/unicode
    optional so config defaults apply; wire settings loading in main
  - Add Unicode edge case tests (emoji, CJK, combining marks), empty
    state tests, invalid capture ref test, and config deserialization tests
- Resolve clippy field_reassign_with_default and add launch monitor
Use struct initialization with ..Default::default() instead of mutable
  field reassignment in config_tests to satisfy clippy on Rust 1.93.

  Also adds HN/Reddit comment notification monitor script and updates
  .gitignore for monitor state file.

  - Extract layout computation for mouse hit-testing (PanelLayout struct)
  - Update status bar hints, README features/shortcuts/comparison, demo assets


## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-22

### Bug Fixes

- Remap help key from ? to F1 so ? can be typed in patterns
The ? key was intercepted by ShowHelp before reaching InsertChar,
  making it impossible to type common regex syntax like (?P<name>...),
  \w+?, (?:...), etc. Remap help to F1 and add UI tests for match
  display rendering and multi-line test strings.
- Prevent subtraction overflow in regex input on zero-size terminals
Use saturating_sub for title truncation width and cursor bounds checks
  to avoid panicking when the render area has zero width or height.

### Features

- Fix named captures, add scrollable panels and multi-line editor
- Fix named capture groups in fancy-regex and PCRE2 engines by using
    capture_names() API instead of hardcoding None
  - Add scrollable match display and explanation panels with focus cycling
    across all 4 panels (Tab), scroll via Up/Down on focused panel
  - Implement multi-line test string editor with Enter for newlines,
    Up/Down cursor navigation, vertical scroll, and line-aware highlighting
  - Grow test string area from 3 to 8 rows for multi-line content
- Add regex pattern syntax highlighting in the input field
Color parentheses, quantifiers, character classes, escapes, anchors,
  and alternation operators using the Catppuccin palette. Walks the
  regex-syntax AST to categorize tokens and builds colored ratatui spans.
  Falls back to plain text on parse failure.
- Add live replace/substitution mode with highlighted preview
Add a replacement input panel between test string and results area,
  enabling real-time substitution preview. Supports $1, ${name}, $0/$&,
  and $$ syntax. Engine-agnostic replacement operates on computed match
  data so it works identically across all three engines.

  - Add ReplaceSegment, ReplaceResult, expand_replacement(), replace_all()
  - Add replace_editor, replace_result state to App with rereplace() chain
  - New ReplaceInput widget (single-line, panel index 2)
  - MatchDisplay renders highlighted preview (green bg for replacements)
  - Layout updated from 4 to 5 panels, Tab cycles all five
  - CLI flag -r/--replacement for initial replacement string
  - 12 new tests (7 unit + 5 integration)


## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-22

### Features

    to rgx.rb (class RgxCli -> Rgx) for `brew install brevity1swos/tap/rgx`


## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-22

### Bug Fixes

- Use absolute URL for demo GIF so it renders on crates.io
crates.io doesn't serve repository assets, so relative paths like
  assets/demo.gif don't work. Use the raw.githubusercontent.com URL.

### Features

- Add social preview image (1280x640)
Catppuccin Mocha themed preview showing the TUI with pattern input,
  colored capture group highlights, match results, and explanation panel.
  Includes the generation script for reproducibility.


## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-22

### Bug Fixes

- Add allow-dirty for cargo-dist CI workflow validation
cargo-dist validates that .github/workflows/release.yml matches its
  expected content, but we use a custom dist.yml workflow that integrates
  with release-plz. The allow-dirty = ["ci"] setting skips this check.


## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-22

### Miscellaneous

- Set up cargo-dist v0.30.4 for prebuilt binary distribution
Adds dist.yml workflow triggered by version tags to build binaries for
  5 targets (linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS x86_64/aarch64, Windows x86_64)
  and upload them to GitHub Releases created by release-plz.


## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-22

### Bug Fixes

- Bust GitHub CDN cache for demo GIF
Add query parameter to demo.gif URL to force GitHub's camo CDN
  to fetch the updated image instead of serving the stale cache.


## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-22

### Bug Fixes

- Regenerate demo GIF with working rgx binary
Previous demo GIF was recorded before rgx was installed, showing
  a blank terminal. Regenerated with VHS using bash shell that
  inherits PATH with ~/.cargo/bin.

### Features

- Initial release of rgx — regex101 for the terminal
Interactive TUI with real-time matching, 3 regex engines (Rust regex,
  fancy-regex, PCRE2), capture group highlighting with distinct colors,
  plain-English explanation engine, flag toggles, stdin pipe support,
  and cross-platform support.

  Includes full CI/CD automation (test matrix, clippy, fmt, coverage,
  release-plz, cargo-dist), dependabot config, and issue templates.
